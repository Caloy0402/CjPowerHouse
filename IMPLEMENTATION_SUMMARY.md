### What Changed?
Before: You could update any order to "Ready to Ship"
Now: System checks stock first and warns you if there's not enough

### New Warning Modal
**When you see it:**
- Red header says "Insufficient Stock Warning"
- Table shows which items are out of stock

**What it means:**
- Order cannot be fulfilled
- Not enough products in warehouse
- Customer ordered more than available

**What to do:**
1. **Option 1: Close and wait**
   - Click "Close" button
   - Order stays pending
   - Wait for restock
   - Try again later

2. **Option 2: Cancel order (Recommended)**
   - Click "Cancel Order & Notify Customer"
   - System cancels automatically
   - Customer gets detailed explanation
   - No need to call or message customer

### Customer Notification
**What customer receives:**
- Clear explanation of what happened
- Details about each out-of-stock item
- Information about next steps
- Professional apology
- Contact information

**You don't need to:**
- ‚ùå Write a cancellation message
- ‚ùå Call the customer
- ‚ùå Send manual notification
- ‚úÖ Just click the button!

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Modal Not Appearing
**Problem:** Warning modal doesn't show when stock is insufficient
**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify `check_stock_availability.php` is uploaded
3. Check file permissions (should be readable by web server)
4. Verify database connection in `dbconn.php`

### Stock Check Always Fails
**Problem:** Always shows insufficient stock even when available
**Solutions:**
1. Check `products` table - verify `Quantity` column exists
2. Check `order_items` table - verify `product_id` and `quantity` columns
3. Verify product IDs match between tables
4. Check SQL query in `check_stock_availability.php`

### Cancellation Not Working
**Problem:** Cancel button doesn't work
**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `cancel_order_insufficient_stock.php` is uploaded
3. Check `orders` table has `reason` column
4. Verify proper permissions on files

### Customer Not Receiving Notification
**Problem:** Order cancelled but customer doesn't see message
**Solutions:**
1. Check `orders` table - verify `reason` field is populated
2. Verify customer can view order history
3. Check if customer interface displays `reason` field
4. May need to integrate with email/SMS system (future enhancement)
