# PayMongo Deployment Instructions

## Why the secrets.php file appears grayed out

The `secrets.php` file is intentionally **grayed out** in your IDE because it's listed in `.gitignore`. This is a **security best practice** to prevent sensitive API keys from being committed to Git repositories.

## Why you're getting the error

The error occurs because `secrets.php` is not being tracked by Git (it's in .gitignore), so it hasn't been uploaded to your production server.

## Solution: Configure the secret key

You now have three supported ways to provide your PayMongo secret key. Pick ONE:

1) Environment variable (recommended)

- Set `PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY` on the server. For split keys, you can also set:
  - `PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY_TEST` and/or `PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY_LIVE`
  - Optional `PAYMONGO_USE_LIVE` ("true"/"false") to pick the env to use

2) `.env` file (simple)

- Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```
PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key
# or, split keys
PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY_TEST=sk_test_your_key
PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY_LIVE=sk_live_your_key
PAYMONGO_USE_LIVE=false
```

3) `secrets.php` (legacy/explicit)

Since this file contains sensitive API keys, you must **manually upload it** to your production server.

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Locate the file** on your local machine:
   - File path: `C:\Users\MY PC\Desktop\Git Upload\CjPowerHouse\secrets.php`

2. **Upload to production server:**
   - Use FTP client (FileZilla, WinSCP, etc.)
   - Or use cPanel File Manager
   - Upload the file to the same directory as your other PHP files (wherever `create_paymongo_payment.php` is located)

3. **Verify file exists on server:**
   - The file should be in the root of your web application

## File Contents

The file currently contains:
- ‚úÖ TEST API keys (for development/testing)
- ‚úÖ LIVE API keys (for production)
- üîÑ Environment switcher to toggle between TEST and LIVE

## To Use Different Environments

Edit `secrets.php` on the server and change line 17:
- `$USE_LIVE_KEYS = false;` ‚Üê For TEST/Development
- `$USE_LIVE_KEYS = true;` ‚Üê For LIVE/Production

## Security Notes

- ‚úÖ The file is correctly in `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ Never commit this file to Git
- ‚úÖ Keep it private and secure
- ‚úÖ Only upload it directly to your server

## Testing

After configuring the key using any method above, test the GCash flow. You should be redirected to the PayMongo checkout page. If not, check your logs for `[PayMongo] Create Source failed` messages.
