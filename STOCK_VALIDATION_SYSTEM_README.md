# Stock Validation System - Order Processing

## Overview
This system prevents cashiers from marking orders as "Ready to Ship" when there's insufficient stock to fulfill the order. It provides real-time stock validation and automated customer notifications.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Real-Time Stock Validation**
- Automatically checks stock availability when cashier attempts to update order to "Ready to Ship"
- Compares ordered quantity vs. available stock for each item
- Prevents order processing if any item has insufficient stock

### 2. **Warning Modal Interface**
When insufficient stock is detected:
- Displays a professional warning modal with complete details
- Shows table of items with stock shortages:
  - Product image
  - Product name
  - Ordered quantity
  - Available stock
  - Shortage amount
- Provides clear guidance to the cashier

### 3. **Automated Order Cancellation**
When cashier cancels due to insufficient stock:
- Order status automatically set to "Cancelled"
- Customer receives detailed notification explaining:
  - Which items are out of stock
  - Ordered quantity vs. available stock
  - Next steps for the customer
  - No payment charged/refunded if applicable

### 4. **Customer-Friendly Notifications**
Cancellation message includes:
```
ORDER CANCELLED - Insufficient Stock

We sincerely apologize, but we had to cancel your order due to insufficient stock...

• [Product Name]
  - You ordered: X pcs
  - Available stock: Y pcs
  - Short by: Z pcs

What happens next:
• Your order has been automatically cancelled
• No payment has been charged
• You can place a new order with adjusted quantities

We apologize for any inconvenience...
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. **check_stock_availability.php** - Backend stock validation endpoint
2. **cancel_order_insufficient_stock.php** - Automated cancellation handler
3. **STOCK_VALIDATION_SYSTEM_README.md** - This documentation

### Modified Files:
1. **Cashier-COD-Delivery.php** - Added stock validation for COD orders
2. **Cashier-GCASH-Delivery.php** - Added stock validation for GCASH orders

## How It Works

### Workflow:

1. **Cashier Reviews Order**
   - Opens pending order in Cashier-COD-Delivery.php or Cashier-GCASH-Delivery.php
   - Selects rider (if required)
   - Clicks "Update Order" to mark as "Ready to Ship"

2. **Stock Validation (Automatic)**
   - System calls `check_stock_availability.php`
   - Checks each order item against current stock levels
   - Returns result: sufficient or insufficient

3. **Sufficient Stock Path**
   - Order proceeds normally
   - Status updated to "Ready to Ship"
   - Stock quantities deducted
   - Order moves to next stage

4. **Insufficient Stock Path**
   - Warning modal displayed automatically
   - Shows detailed stock shortage information
   - Order details modal closes
   - Cashier sees two options:
     - Close (review and wait for restock)
     - Cancel Order & Notify Customer

5. **Order Cancellation (If Selected)**
   - System calls `cancel_order_insufficient_stock.php`
   - Order status set to "Cancelled"
   - Detailed reason stored in database
   - Customer notification sent
   - Page reloads to show updated status

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Validation (check_stock_availability.php)
```php
- Queries order_items JOIN products
- Compares ordered_quantity vs. available Quantity
- Returns JSON response with:
  - success: boolean
  - has_insufficient_stock: boolean
  - insufficient_items: array (if applicable)
```

### Cancellation Handler (cancel_order_insufficient_stock.php)
```php
- Receives order_id and insufficient_items
- Builds detailed customer-friendly message
- Updates orders table:
  - order_status = 'Cancelled'
  - reason = detailed explanation
- Returns success/error response
```

### Frontend Implementation
```javascript
1. Stock Check (AJAX)
   - Triggered on "Update Order" click
   - Calls check_stock_availability.php
   - Handles response

2. Modal Display
   - Populated with insufficient items
   - Styled with Bootstrap 5
   - Table format for clarity

3. Cancellation (AJAX)
   - Sends insufficient items to backend
   - Handles response
   - Reloads page on success
```

## Example Scenario

**Before Implementation:**
1. Customer orders 10 items (only 9 in stock)
2. Cashier marks as "Ready to Ship"
3. Stock goes negative (-1)
4. Delivery fails when preparing package
5. Manual phone call to customer
6. Confusion and delays

**After Implementation:**
1. Customer orders 10 items (only 9 in stock)
2. Cashier clicks "Update Order"
3. System shows: "Insufficient Stock Warning"
4. Modal displays: "Ordered: 10, Available: 9, Short by: 1"
5. Cashier clicks "Cancel Order & Notify Customer"
6. Customer receives detailed explanation automatically
7. No inventory errors, clear communication

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with sufficient stock** - Order should process normally
2. **Test with insufficient stock** - Warning modal should appear
3. **Test cancellation** - Order should cancel and customer notified
4. **Test multiple items** - Some sufficient, some insufficient
5. **Test with 0 stock** - Should show in warning modal
6. **Test modal responsiveness** - Check on different screen sizes

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Email notifications to customers
- SMS notifications for cancelled orders
- Inventory restock suggestions
- Automatic product recommendations
- Analytics dashboard for stock-related cancellations
- Integration with supplier ordering system
