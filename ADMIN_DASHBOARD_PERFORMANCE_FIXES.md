# Admin Dashboard Performance Optimizations

## Issues Fixed
1. **Memory Leaks**: Multiple timers and SSE connections not properly cleaned up when navigating away
2. **Resource Overload**: Too frequent updates causing lag
3. **Visual Noise**: Update notifications appearing too often

## Changes Made

### 1. Proper Resource Cleanup
- Added `cleanupDashboardResources()` function that:
  - Clears all intervals (`dashboardInterval`, `revenueInterval`, `helpRequestInterval`)
  - Closes all SSE connections (`dashboardEventSource`, `helpRequestsEventSource`, `staffEventSource`)
  - Destroys charts (`weeklyOrdersChart`, `revenueChart`)
- Added `beforeunload` event listener to cleanup when navigating away
- Added `visibilitychange` event listener to pause/resume updates when switching tabs

### 2. Reduced Update Frequency
- Changed fallback polling interval from **15 seconds to 30 seconds**
- This reduces unnecessary database queries and API calls

### 3. Reduced Visual Noise
- Update notifications now only show on **initial load**, not on every update
- Reduced notification display time from 3 seconds to 2 seconds
- Prevents notification spam that causes visual lag

### 4. Visibility-Based Resource Management
- When the dashboard is in a hidden tab/window:
  - Closes SSE connections to save resources
  - Stops processing updates
- When dashboard becomes visible again:
  - Reconnects SSE connections
  - Resumes real-time updates

## Benefits
1. **Faster Page Navigation**: No resource leaks when switching pages
2. **Less CPU Usage**: Reduced update frequency and proper cleanup
3. **Better User Experience**: No annoying notification spam
4. **Improved Browser Performance**: Closes connections when page is hidden

## How It Works Now

### On Page Load
1. Initialize notification sound system
2. Start dashboard SSE connection
3. Start help requests SSE connection
4. Initialize weekly orders chart
5. Start fallback polling (30 seconds)

### On Page Unload
1. Clear all intervals
2. Close all SSE connections
3. Destroy all charts
4. Free up memory

### On Tab Switch (Hidden/Visible)
- **Hidden**: Pause all SSE connections
- **Visible**: Resume all SSE connections

## Performance Metrics
- **Before**: Multiple intervals running every 15 seconds, SSE connections always open, no cleanup on navigation
- **After**: Single 30-second interval, paused when hidden, proper cleanup on navigation
